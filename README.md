 This current skin is tested with Thetis v2.10.0.0-HL2 by MI0BOT.

 It uses high resolution quality graphics and hopefully will
 suit for dark viewing environments.

 I have not tested this skin with other software like PowerSDR
 besides the version described previously. This skin is provided 
 as-is without any warranty that there will be no visual defects or 
 create instability on any of the OpenHPSDR family softwares.
 
 There are known graphical issues in "Collapse" Mode where some
 of the graphics go out of their visual aspect positions as
 some graphics are stretched within Thetis software.

 You can adjust the appearance to your liking. Note that you should
 not change the dark grey background color as buttons won't look as
 good since there does not seem to be support for transparancy
 as of this moment.
